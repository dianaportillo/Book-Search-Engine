# Book-Search-Engine

## Description
My task was to create an app that allows the user to do a book search. This will call for an API search engine and allow the user
to input any book name. This app will require you to use MERN stack, Apollo server, Express, Mongodb, GraphQl as well Node.js. You will need to create 
an Apollo provider, and a Mongodb database. 

## Installation
CD into the client and cd into server on two separate terminals. To being the app run npm i on both server. The again on both servers 
run npm start this will open up the local host on its own. 

## Technologies Used:
React
Mongodb
Apollo Server
GraphQl
Express.js 
Node.js
